## 9:00am - The Gang Builds a Web App

### Starting Out

At the stroke of 09:00 hours, our hackathon team came together on Discord for some project planning.

We simultaneously watched a video from the NASA team, which helped greatly with realising the project requirements.

### Research

Our base abstraction of the problem was to take all of the possible inputs and outputs to form a sleep-shift scheduling algorithm.

Inputs:

- Launch/Landing and Docking/Undocking Times
- Dates and Times of International Travel
- Airport of the Travel Destination's Layover Times
- Dates and times of Mission-Control
- Normal Sleep Hours of the Individual
- Morning, Intermediate or Evening

Outputs:

- Sleeping, Eating and Exercise Times
- Blue Light-Blocking Glasses
- Naps
- Melatonin and Other Biological Medication
- Alertness Medication from the Individual's Flight Surgeon
- Eye Masks and Ear Plugs

### Splitting up

With this research method identified, we divided into small agile teams in order to begin executing our web application.

- Lewis Lloyd - Database Design
- Marija SoldatoviÄ‡ - Frontend Design
- Matt Drayton - Research
- James Karpinski - Research
